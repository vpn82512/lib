# F-Droid
Termux application can be obtained from F-Droid from here.
https://f-droid.org
You do not need to download the F-Droid app (via the Download F-Droid link) to install Termux. You can download the Termux APK directly from the site by clicking the Download APK link at the bottom of each version section.

It usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on F-Droid once an update has been released on GitHub. The F-Droid releases are built and published by F-Droid once they detect a new GitHub release. The Termux maintainers do not have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on F-Droid. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of F-Droid releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on GitHub that would be compatible with F-Droid releases.

The F-Droid app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the Updates tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check https://dontkillmyapp.com/ for details on how to do that.

Only a universal APK is released, which will work on all supported architectures. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be ~180MB. F-Droid does not support architecture specific APKs.
